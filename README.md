<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
This work presents the development of an application that seeks to make literacy practice feasible for autistic children, who have learning difficulties. The project proposes to help autistic children, through a technological platform, during their first school steps, which is when they may have more difficulties, due to the limitations that Autism Spectrum Disorder can offer. It is expected that, through application, children will be able to fully develop in their literacy.
